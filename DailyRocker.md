# DailyRocker
### The place for music lovers to come together!



## Elevator Pitch:
It's cool how everyone loves doing the wordle. Wouldn't it be neat if there was a website for music that was fun to visit like that? Daily Rocker is a website that lets people learn about musicians of the past and present. Every week a new musician will be chosen from its database, and an album will even be listed as a recommendation to the user. On top of that, users can vote on different artists and answer a fun trivia question relating to each artist. We could even give each month a theme!

## Key Features:
My website is for music educational & entertainment purposes. Every week it will feature a different musician from a particular decade (the decades will vary monthly). Along with the musicians there will also be fun facts, a recommended album to listen to, and a fun trivia question.

## How Technology Will Be Utilized:
### HTML
Will have proper HTML formatting for web page. And additional pages for the musician leaderboard, and trivia game.

### CSS


### React
Allow users to vote on artists they like/dislike. And the trivia question.

### Service


### DB/Login


### WebSocket


## Early Concept of DailyRocker.com
