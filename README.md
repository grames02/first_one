# DailyRocker
### The place for music lovers to come together!

## Elevator Pitch:
It's cool how everyone loves doing the wordle. Wouldn't it be neat if there was a website for music that was fun to visit like that? Daily Rocker is a website that lets people learn about musicians of the past and present. Every week a new musician will be chosen from its database, and an album will even be listed as a recommendation to the user. On top of that, users can vote on different artists and answer a fun trivia question relating to each artist. We could even give each month a theme!

## Key Features:
My website is for music educational & entertainment purposes. Every week it will feature a different musician from a particular decade (the decades will vary monthly). Along with the musicians' there will also be fun facts, a recommended album to listen to, and a fun trivia question.

## How Technology Will Be Utilized:
### HTML
Will have proper HTML formatting for the webpage, and for the additional pages (musician leaderboard, trivia game).

### CSS
Will have a simple but classic website appearance. Good look for smartphones and computers.

### React
Allow users to vote on artists they like/dislike. And the trivia question.

### Service
Backend service for login, votes, and new trivia questions.

### DB/Login
We will have the user's votes stored for the artist leaderboard.

### WebSocket
The votes will be viewable for all users on the leaderboard page.

## Early Concept of DailyRocker.com

# With the HTML Deliverable
## Main Things I did
I went into the Simon example, and swapped out a lot. I mainly used the formula given and renamed things for my page. It actually worked fairly well.
I am excited to keep learning. I created sections such as: Past Artists, Top Artists, and a fun Trivia Game. All of these will be more fleshed out in the future.

One thing that took me FOREVER!!!!! Was getting it to publish properly. I didn't see the note about PowerShell.... Eventually, I finally changed the terminal and was able to publish it properly.
