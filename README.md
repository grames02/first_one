## Elevator Pitch: It's cool how everyone loves doing the wordle. Wouldn't it be neat if there was a website for music that was fun to visit like that? Daily Rocker is a website that lets people learn about musicians of the past and present. Every week a new musician will be chosen from its database, and an album will even be listed as a recommendation to the user.
